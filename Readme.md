Every language has a software which understands the syntax structure of the language. Ex - interpreter, compiler.
For years this software for JS was inside the browsers. But now it's easily available so now we can execute JS standalone. Now JS is not just a browser/frontend language.
NodeJS is one the environments which helps us execute JS. DinoJS is also onw of them.
